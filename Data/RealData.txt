The real data is publicly available via http://www.humanconnectome.org/
You need three versions of two HCP subjects, 115320 and 118730:
1) Volumes/CIFTI of RAW dataset
2) Volumes/CIFTI of minimally pre-processed data (choose pre-processed)
3) Volumes/CIFTI of fully pre-processed data (conventionally called ICA-FIX)

NB each version is more than 4GB. So you, at least, need 12GB of free space.
